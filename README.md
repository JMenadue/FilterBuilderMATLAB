# FilterBuilderMATLAB

A piano note sample (C5) has been used as the target audio file to remove harmonics from. The script then consists of 5 different filters 
each filtering either the fundamental or one of the next 4 harmonics. The script allowsthe user to input the audio sample and select which
harmonic to remove. It will play back both the samples and provide graphs to analyse the filtered and unfiltered audio files based upon 
time and frequency domains. 

All necessary files/code included as well as examples of the resulting audio files, named as the corresponding filtered harmonic.
